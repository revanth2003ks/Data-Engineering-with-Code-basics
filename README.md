# Data-Engineering-with-Code-basics
Documenting my Data Engineering learning journey with Codebasics, covering SQL, Python, ETL pipelines, Spark, Airflow, and real-world projects


# 🚀 Data Engineering Journey – Codebasics

Hi, I'm Revanth KS, a Data Analytics enthusiast transitioning into Data Engineering.
This repository documents my complete learning journey through the Codebasics Data Engineering program.

## 🎯 Goal
To gain hands-on experience in building scalable, real-world data pipelines and prepare for Data Engineer roles.

## 🧠 Skills Covered
- SQL (Advanced Queries, Optimization)
- Python for Data Engineering
- ETL / ELT Pipelines
- Data Warehousing
- Apache Spark & PySpark
- Airflow (Workflow Orchestration)
- Cloud Fundamentals (GCP/AWS)

📅 Day 1 – SQL Basics

Today, I revised and practiced fundamental SQL commands essential for data engineering and analytics.

🔹 Topics Covered

SELECT – retrieve data from tables

* – select all columns

FROM – specify the source table

WHERE – filter records based on conditions

DISTINCT – return unique values

COUNT() – count number of records

% Wildcard – pattern matching

LIKE – search data using patterns

🔹 Key Learning

These commands form the foundation for querying, filtering, and analyzing structured data, which is crucial for building reliable data pipelines.

📅 Day 2 – SQL Data Retrieval

Focused on retrieving data efficiently from both single and multiple tables using SQL.

🔹 Topics Covered
1️⃣ Data Retrieval – Single Table

SELECT with specific columns

WHERE conditions

ORDER BY

LIMIT

GROUP BY with aggregate functions

2️⃣ Data Retrieval – Multiple Tables

INNER JOIN

LEFT JOIN

RIGHT JOIN

Understanding table relationships using primary & foreign keys

🔹 Key Learning

Learned how to combine data from multiple tables to generate meaningful insights—an essential skill for real-world data engineering pipelines.
